// This file contains the PeerConnection interface as defined in
// https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-pc/#peer-to-peer-connections
//
// The PeerConnectionFactory class provides factory methods to create
// PeerConnection, MediaStream and MediaStreamTrack objects.
//
// The following steps are needed to setup a typical call using WebRTC:
//
// 1. Create a PeerConnectionFactoryInterface. Check constructors for more
// information about input parameters.
//
// 2. Create a PeerConnection object. Provide a configuration struct which
// points to STUN and/or TURN servers used to generate ICE candidates, and
// provide an object that implements the PeerConnectionObserver interface,
// which is used to receive callbacks from the PeerConnection.
//
// 3. Create local MediaStreamTracks using the PeerConnectionFactory and add
// them to PeerConnection by calling AddTrack (or legacy method, AddStream).
//
// 4. Create an offer, call SetLocalDescription with it, serialize it, and send
// it to the remote peer
//
// 5. Once an ICE candidate has been gathered, the PeerConnection will call the
// observer function OnIceCandidate. The candidates must also be serialized and
// sent to the remote peer.
//
// 6. Once an answer is received from the remote peer, call
// SetRemoteDescription with the remote answer.
//
// 7. Once a remote candidate is received from the remote peer, provide it to
// the PeerConnection by calling AddIceCandidate.
//
// The receiver of a call (assuming the application is "call"-based) can decide
// to accept or reject the call; this decision will be taken by the application,
// not the PeerConnection.
//
// If the application decides to accept the call, it should:
//
// 1. Create PeerConnectionFactoryInterface if it doesn't exist.
//
// 2. Create a new PeerConnection.
//
// 3. Provide the remote offer to the new PeerConnection object by calling
// SetRemoteDescription.
//
// 4. Generate an answer to the remote offer by calling CreateAnswer and send it
// back to the remote peer.
//
// 5. Provide the local answer to the new PeerConnection by calling
// SetLocalDescription with the answer.
//
// 6. Provide the remote ICE candidates by calling AddIceCandidate.
//
// 7. Once a candidate has been gathered, the PeerConnection will call the
// observer function OnIceCandidate. Send these candidates to the remote peer.
